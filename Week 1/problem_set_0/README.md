a game made on Scratch

target: harry gets to the forbidden forest
obstacles: harry or his teammates can't touch the wall or any enemy
teammates: ron and hermione. useless except chatting with harry
enemies: draco, snape, filtch, mcgonagall

total levels: 7
level 1: just harry
level 2: harry and ron
level 3: harry and ron and hermoine
level 4: harry and ron and hermoine + draco
level 5: harry and ron and hermoine + draco and filch
level 6: harry and ron and hermoine + draco and filch and snape
level 7: harry and ron and hermoine + mcgonagall

ideas for future versions:
- if draco catches harry, he will bring him to a teacher
- replace "Got Caught!" counter with the Gryffindor house point hourglasses
- ron can find clutter to block a path so that enemy can't encounter them anymore
- hermione can detect when the enemy wants to take a nap
- harry can use the invisibility clock once (except to filch)
